Welcome to my website! I'm currently a Master's student at the University of Washington, Seattle, majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering. My primary areas of interest lie in Machine Learning and Computer Vision. 

I am currently interning at [Alpenglow Biosciences](https://www.alpenglowbiosciences.com/), solving the neural style transfer problem for histopathology. At UW, I am a member of the [GRAIL Lab](https://grail.cs.washington.edu/), advised by [Prof. Linda Shapiro](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~shapiro/). As part of my graduate studies, I have worked on multimodal and contrastive based learning for large hispathology datasets and implementing NeRFs for custom datasets.

I also briefly worked at the [Ubiquitous Computing Lab](https://ubicomplab.cs.washington.edu/), focusing on the noninvasive measurement of vital signals using MMWave Radar for physiological sensing

I completed my Undergraduate Thesis (2022) focussed on optimizing adversarial learning at [Spectrum Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/spectrumlabeeiisc/spectrum-lab?authuser=0), Indian Institute of Science with [Prof. Chandra Sekhar Seelamantula](https://ee.iisc.ac.in/chandra-sekhar-seelamantula/). During my undergraduate studies, I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Jora Gonda](https://eee.nitk.ac.in/professor/JMG) and [Prof. Krishnan CMC](https://sites.google.com/view/krishnan-chemmangat). 

In 2022, I graduated as salutatorian from the National Institute of Technology Karnataka, India, with a Bachelors in Electrical Engineering and minor in Computer Science.
