Welcome to my website! 

I currently work as a Scientific Data Engineer on the Representation Learning team at the [Allen Institute for Cell Science](https://alleninstitute.org/division/cell-science/). Our goal is to develop robust, interpretable deep-learning models for  images of cells - models that not only produce quantitative cell representations but also enable intuitive exploration and interpretation in the latent space.

I graduated with a Master's degree from the University of Washington, Seattle, majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering in the summer of 2024. My primary areas of interest lie in Machine Learning and Computer Vision and was advised by [Prof. Linda Shapiro](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~shapiro/) during grad school. I have worked on an array of topics ranging from representation learning on OCT-IR imaging data to multimodal and contrastive learning for large hispathology datasets and implementing NeRFs to aid in object detection. During the summer and fall of 2023, I had interned at [Alpenglow Biosciences](https://www.alpenglowbiosciences.com/), solving the neural style transfer problem for histopathology. 

<!-- I also briefly worked at the [Ubiquitous Computing Lab](https://ubicomplab.cs.washington.edu/), focusing on the noninvasive measurement of vital signals using MMWave Radar for physiological sensing. -->

I completed my Undergraduate Thesis (2022) focussed on optimizing adversarial learning at [Spectrum Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/spectrumlabeeiisc/spectrum-lab?authuser=0), Indian Institute of Science with [Prof. Chandra Sekhar Seelamantula](https://ee.iisc.ac.in/chandra-sekhar-seelamantula/). During my undergraduate studies, I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Jora Gonda](https://eee.nitk.ac.in/professor/JMG) and [Prof. Krishnan CMC](https://sites.google.com/view/krishnan-chemmangat). 

In 2022, I graduated as salutatorian from the National Institute of Technology Karnataka, India, with a Bachelors in Electrical Engineering and minor in Computer Science.
